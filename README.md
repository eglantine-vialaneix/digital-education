LEFT TODO:

- retrieve user data (from screening questionnaire, pretest, posttest and meta info like number of trials and time on task)(Eglantine)
  - create google docs file OR st form
  - test data retrieval into google sheets

- ~~Embed the video instructions before the simulations and all (Eglantine):n~~
- ITA: https://youtu.be/LLaubZsj0i4
- ENG: https://youtu.be/jC6q_nrbnh0
- FR: https://youtu.be/Jw-PE9NrOKI
  - in home: conditional context video (PSI vs IPS) + language
  - ~~in instructions: conditional instructions video (IPS vs PSI AND language)~~
  - put all the correct video links for PS-I instruction video

- ~~fix the new navigation sustem between pages~~
  - ~~conditional navigation based on PSIvsIPS~~

- refine PS activity
  - ~~repair plotting with number of iterations~~
  - force minimum number of characters for interpretation 
  - ideally make the labels disappear witht the dots when going back in iterations
  - merge with Thomaz version

- ~~Pop up that forces prediction before simulation and/or **interpretation** after (Eglantine)~~

- ~~Try a preliminary exercice about the algorithm itself, before the simulation part (Thomaz)~~
