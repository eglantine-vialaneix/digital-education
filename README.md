# digital-education
A digital learning tool to teach Gradient Descent.

LEFT TODO:

- before testing: put navigation bar off

- retrieve user data (Eglantine)
  - create st form for post and pre tests
  - test data retrieval into supabase

- make the prediction text just below eta and a0


- ~~Embed the video instructions before the simulations and all (Eglantine):n~~
  - ~~in instructions: conditional instructions video (IPS vs PSI AND language)~~
- ITA: https://youtu.be/LLaubZsj0i4
- ENG: https://youtu.be/jC6q_nrbnh0
- FR: https://youtu.be/Jw-PE9NrOKI
  - in home: conditional context video (PSI vs IPS) + language
  - do french PS-I video
  - put all the correct video links for PS-I instruction video

- ~~fix the new navigation sustem between pages~~
  - ~~conditional navigation based on PSIvsIPS~~

- refine PS activity
  - ~~force minimum number of characters for interpretation~~
  - ideally make the labels disappear with the dots when going back in iterations
  - make labels clearer (in bold and bigger font)
  - ~~make better global instructions: your goal is NOT to find the globa minimum only, it is to discover HOW you can always (of most of the time) find it. Your goal is to find the RULE behind finding the minimum.~~
  - ~~repair plotting with number of iterations~~
  - ~~merge with Thomaz version~~

- ~~Pop up that forces prediction before simulation and/or **interpretation** after (Eglantine)~~

- ~~Try a preliminary exercice about the algorithm itself, before the simulation part (Thomaz)~~

- ~~FIX THOMAZ-BRANCH MERGE~~
  - ~~add hard exo from digital-education/app.py into pages/psactivity.py~~
  -~~delete digital-education nested folde~~
