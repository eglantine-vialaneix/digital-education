A digital learning tool to teach Gradient Descent



7-8 items for 10min pre/post - test rather okay (depends on types of questions of course)
-> manually computing a few steps of an iterative algorithm?

pre-test: aim for 30-70% to avoid floor/ceiling effects

guidelines: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J20A073AusOfUbntvcNxpDgQmpM7Pb6qACKaoR4cLtE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.lux34k995g6v


idea: give a key number at end of pre test to assign them semi-manually to a group (ctr vs condition) based on their score without them knowing it

balance gender and backgrounds and age

assigning the group beforehand is also okay, just making sure that we standardize the explanations and all!


- idea of sotyrtelling: you are in the mountain and it is dark, but you have a torch with you. you can only see one step away from you in every direction. surely the highest slope down is the fastest way to the bottom of the mountain!

- having the math only in the I-PS

- have a box that explains the 3 phases and the procedure for the participants (10min - 20? - 10)

- add a cost of running randomly the simulation: example: 
  - change function to minimize
  - write explanation (with minimum of characters) before (like prediction) and/or after (why did it (not) work??) the simulation
  - print the "shadow" of the expected optimal path
  

- have a counter of how many times they try to see how much they (simulation needs to be bug proof so that they don't rerun the thing because it just did not work)

- maybe make it in streamlit but if everyone has already python then not needed!
