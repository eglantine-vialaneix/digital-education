A digital learning tool to teach Gradient Descent

LEFT TODO:

- Pop up that forces prediction before simulation and/or **interpretation** after (Eglantine)

- retrieve user data like number of trials (Eglantine)

- Try a preliminary exercice about the algorithm itself, before the simulation part (Thomaz)

- Write instructions and questions like “the theoritical minimum number of steps is X. what is the best eta to find the minimum?” + Show the formula on page (Eglantine)
